== Description ==
A WooCommerce VeChain (VET) Gateway that allows you to accept VET directly to your own wallet. Simply specify your wallet address, and a QR code and payment information will be displayed to customers on checkout page. 

4 exchanges are used to average the equivalent VET amount relevant to your fiat cost.

Option is enabled to mark up or down a % of VET charged to offer discounts if VET is used or to enable higher charges.

Once payment is made, your order will be updated to pending for you to confirm it, as with all WooCommerce Products.

This is a free plugin but VET tips are welcome at
